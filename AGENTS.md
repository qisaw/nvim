This git repository contains my neovim configuration files and related scriptss.

# Neovim Configuration
I use Neovim as my primary text editor for code. I use Lazy.nvim as my plugin manager and have configured various plugins to enhance my coding experience.

I mostly work with the following programming languages:
- Typescript
- Lua
- Terraform
- Bash

I use the following frameworks often:
- Prisma (for database management)
- Node.js (for backend development)
- React (for frontend development)
- Next.js (for server-side rendering and static site generation)


You can see the initial setup in ./init.lua and further configurations in the lua/ directory.

I use the "Workman P" keyboard layout, so that is why I have remapped some keys (e.g. hjkl to yneo for navigation).
